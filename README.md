# FlyTracking
This project trained a model based on YOLOv5 and DeepSORT and built an interface for fly tracking in experimental videos. Our model can stably identify different fruit flies even in the low-fps videos. It's suitable for fruit fly courtship analysis, as well as other animals behavior videos.

## Requirement
